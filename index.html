                Kyle Harris spends most of his time doing schoolwork, going to his job, or hanging at home with his suitemates. 
                    After finding Garnet Gate 2.0, he was able to find activities, events, and clubs that best suited his interests. 
                    For example, even though Kyle is a business major, he's always been intereseted in math. 
                    When he found Math Team he was excited to be around likeminded people who can help him explore his love for math. 
                    Now, Kyle doesn't spend his Saturday afternoons alone in bed. Insteadm he gets food with his math friends before going to a competition.
